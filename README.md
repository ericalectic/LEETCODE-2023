## Introduction

LeetCode is a fantastic platform for honing your coding skills and preparing for technical interviews. In this repository, you'll find my Java solutions to a variety of LeetCode problems. Each solution is well-documented and includes explanations of the thought process and approach taken.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized by problem difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard), and each problem has its dedicated folder. The folder name is usually the problem's title in a snake_case format. Inside each folder, you'll find the Java solution file (e.g., `Solution.java`).
